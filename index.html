    <h3>My Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h3>
    <p>
      I believe Web Acessibility is very important for everyone around. What web acessibility means to me is as follows: Navigation on technology and websites that are easier for people with disabilities and illnesses. As to "why" it's important to have a web accessible website is because it'll give your website more customers/viewers and will guarentee not having you be sued. For example, older guest may need their cursor to be darker so it won't blend in to the white background, or even making the text bigger and bolder for them to easily see. Another example could be voice activated. Some people are blind, and if there happens to be a option on the website to be voice-respondent, this could be valuable to blind people AND lazy people. A big reason to have web accessibility is inclusion, and if your website doesn't have this, this could get you sued for not following the ADA guidelines. For example, a streaming service I watch, Netflix, was sued in 2012 by the National Association of Deaf for not having Closed Captions on their novies, causing hearing-impared unable to access movies like other users. Netflix paid $755,000+ to the NDA because they didn't have a web accessible streaming service. In my final observation, Web Accessibility is the binding piece of having an inclusive and operating wesbite, no matter how good your website is, if you dont have this key concept, you might as well have no website at all.

    <h3>Progressive Enhancement Writing</h3>
    <p>
      Progressive Enhancement is the essential CONTENT of a website used to make consumers gain infromation and have a simple mechanic of navigation. Progressive Enhancement helps coders design a website thats the best version of itself, also includs Web Accessibility into the mix. I believe Progressive Enhancement is good for a web developer because even though this can make a website seem simple to navigate, it: "progresses the user experience up to a more-compelling, fully-featured experience for users of newer browsers and devices with richer capabilities."(<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement">Mozilla</a>) Progressive Enhancement, can be shortened to PE, which gives you an example of how it works. In PE, you have to do multiple warm-ups before getting to the fun part of coding, the end. In the article, there is content, presentation, and the client-slide scripting. The warmups will be considered the content and presentation, and the ending will be considered the client-scripting.

    <h3>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      I aked my mother, Marion Evette Bone, who works for Cardinal Health and is on the computer everyday, and my older sister, Candace Shelton, who works as a Real Esate Agent, both gave me feedback on my website. Firstly, they said the bannaer at the top, the dark blue color, clashed with the photos, headings, and words. They then commented on the bottom footer, how the options were on the left bottom of the screen instead of the middle-bottom. My mother, who is the regal age of 45, wondered where the mouse was, and that made me think about Web Accessibility for older people. That's why in my final, I changed the white screen to a light blue, made the banner black with a dark blue hue, and made the footer be in the middle, and added a SVG background behind the words. My sister brought up the words turning purple when the link is clicked, and that made it unreadable if you tried to click on the same option twice. So I coded in the words to stay whitr and not turn purple when the link was visited. Both of them agreed that the text was chunky and words could be hard to read because of how close the letter were together. After I showed them the final project, they both had their own personal gripes, but other than that, everything was fine. This project was very harsh towards me, however. When I first started the project, I couldn't really work on it because I had personal challenges in my life dealing with my family and going to the hospital for complications that happened after I had my car wreck, but I tried and did my best, and I am very happy with the final results. My semester for this class was very exoerimental and made me learn a lot. I joined college thinking of everything I'm doing as a "process needed to get a piece of paper to show I'm worth something" and that "I'm only doing this major for the salary I'll be receiving in my future career." The thing is, I love being creative and coding a website is an outlet that helps me with that, I believe coding is very intuitive and a learning-based field, but you can't miss anything or mispell any word or your entire code will be wrong. Validating your code is a fun final step in your completion process, and making sure everything is right, but if I had no idea about validating code, I'd be stuck. Things I did well this semester would be going back and re-learning techniques and coding needed by watching the reording for classes, I'm proud of the self-improvement I underwent, from my first project in this class to my final. If I had to start over, I would make sure that I need to add "link href="assets/css/style.css" rel="stylesheet"/>" when moving my work from CodePen to Github, AND that I mostly need to work in Github so my "vscode" would stop messing up and corrupting my codespaces on Github. In my final observation, I'm glad I took this class (even though I technically didn't need this class because the 1 credit I'm given for this would have been given in my PEAW class), I'm really glad I put myself out there for my work.
