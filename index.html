    <h3>My Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h3>
    <p>
      I believe Web Acessibility is very important for everyone around. What web acessibility means to me is as follows: Navigation on technology and websites that are easier for people with disabilities and illnesses. As to "why" it's important to have a web accessible website is because it'll give your website more customers/viewers and will guarentee not having you be sued. For example, older guest may need their cursor to be darker so it won't blend in to the white background, or even making the text bigger and bolder for them to easily see. Another example could be voice activated. Some people are blind, and if there happens to be a option on the website to be voice-respondent, this could be valuable to blind people AND lazy people. A big reason to have web accessibility is inclusion, and if your website doesn't have this, this could get you sued for not following the ADA guidelines. For example, a streaming service I watch, Netflix, was sued in 2012 by the National Association of Deaf for not having Closed Captions on their novies, causing hearing-impared unable to access movies like other users. Netflix paid $755,000+ to the NDA because they didn't have a web accessible streaming service. In my final observation, Web Accessibility is the binding piece of having an inclusive and operating wesbite, no matter how good your website is, if you dont have this key concept, you might as well have no website at all.

    <h3>Progressive Enhancement Writing</h3>
    <p>
      Progressive Enhancement is the essential CONTENT of a website used to make consumers gain infromation and have a simple mechanic of navigation. Progressive Enhancement helps coders design a website thats the best version of itself, also includs Web Accessibility into the mix. I believe Progressive Enhancement is good for a web developer because even though this can make a website seem simple to navigate, it: "progresses the user experience up to a more-compelling, fully-featured experience for users of newer browsers and devices with richer capabilities."(<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement">Mozilla</a>) Progressive Enhancement, can be shortened to PE, which gives you an example of how it works. In PE, you have to do multiple warm-ups before getting to the fun part of coding, the end. In the article, there is content, presentation, and the client-slide scripting. The warmups will be considered the content and presentation, and the ending will be considered the client-scripting.
