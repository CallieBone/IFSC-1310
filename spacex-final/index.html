    <h2>History Makes The Future</h2>
    <p>Elon Musk's SpaceX has built the Crew Dragon primarily to carry astronauts to the International Space Station. It was developed as part of Nasa's plan to hand over space station flights to American companies, after years of relying on Russian launches.</p>
    <p>Elon Musk on Saturday 30 May 2020, when the Crew Dragon spacecraft carried Nasa astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken into orbit for a rendezvous with the space station, or ISS. It was the first crewed vehicle to fly from US soil since the retirement of the shuttle in 2011..

      The Crew Dragon is equipped with 16 Draco thrusters that manoeuvre the vehicle in orbit. Each Draco is capable of producing 90 pounds of force in the vacuum of space.</p>

          <p>In 2020 SpaceX returned America’s ability to fly NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station on American vehicles for the first time since 2011. In addition to flying astronauts to space for NASA, SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft can also carry commercial astronauts to Earth orbit, the ISS or beyond.</p>

          <h2>Background</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Dragon, a privately developed spacecraft built by the American corporation SpaceX and the first private spacecraft to carry astronauts to orbit. Dragon has a bell-shaped forward compartment that is pressurized and a cylindrical rear compartment called the trunk that is unpressurized. A pair of solar arrays that power the spacecraft are attached to the trunk. Dragon can carry 6,000 kg (13,000 pounds) of supplies to the ISS. </p>
        <p>
          The Dragon spacecraft is capable of carrying up to 7 passengers to and from Earth orbit, and beyond. It is the only spacecraft currently flying that is capable of returning significant amounts of cargo to Earth, and is the first private spacecraft to take humans to the space station.
